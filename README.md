# FinTech_Module_21_Challenge

# Background

(From the assignment) "After waiting for years and passing several tests, you were selected by the Martian Aerospace Agency to be part of the first human colony on Mars. As a prominent fintech professional, you were chosen to lead a project to develop a monetary system for the new Mars colony. You have decided to base this new monetary system on blockchain technology, and to define a new cryptocurrency called KaseiCoin. KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant. You will launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin. Tokens are minted by using a Crowdsale contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

The crowdsale contract that you create will manage the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KAI, or KaseiCoin tokens. Your contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction."
